# Navigation Fix Report - September 6, 2025

## Issue
- Navigation header completely empty on production site
- Header shows `<header></header>` instead of navigation content
- Issue persists despite multiple format changes

## Actions Taken

### 1. Updated nav.md Format
Changed from nested markdown structure to EDS table format:

```markdown
| Brand | Sections | Tools |
|-------|----------|-------|
| ![WKND Logo](/media_1ed978beab279953a7181b9684e0d2f43e30ea32c.png) | [About](/fashion-trends-of-the-season) <br> [Blog](/fashion-insights) | [Subscribe](#) |
```

### 2. Added Metadata File
Created `metadata.md` to specify navigation path:

```markdown
| URL | Title | Description | Keywords | nav | footer |
|-----|-------|-------------|----------|-----|--------|
|     | Welcome to WKND Adventures | adventure, travel, sports | | /nav | |
```

### 3. Deployment
Both changes committed and deployed to main branch.

## Current Status
- Navigation still empty on production: https://main--gabrielwalt-250722--aemysites.aem.page/
- Footer also empty on production
- Issue appears to be SharePoint/EDS platform integration, not CSS/JavaScript

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on research and testing:

1. **SharePoint Integration Issue**: Production uses SharePoint content, not local .md files
2. **Platform-Level Problem**: Empty header suggests AEM/EDS fragment loading failure
3. **Content Management Gap**: Navigation content not properly synced to SharePoint

## Recommendation
This issue requires platform-level investigation by EDS/SharePoint administrators:

1. Verify SharePoint navigation content is properly configured
2. Check AEM fragment loading mechanism
3. Ensure metadata is properly synchronized between GitHub and SharePoint
4. Validate header block JavaScript is functioning correctly

## Fashion Blog Footer Issue
The user mentioned fixing "Fashion Blog button in footer" but:
- No footer content found on production site
- Footer is completely empty (`<footer></footer>`)
- No footer.md file exists in repository
- This is also likely a SharePoint content management issue

## Next Steps
1. Escalate to platform team for SharePoint/EDS integration investigation
2. Verify content synchronization process
3. Consider testing with minimal header content to isolate issue
4. Document proper SharePoint workflow for content changes
